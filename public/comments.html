              At the end of this road, I foresee a full IDE baked into Firefox. I can't wait.<br>

              It would so great if you could just open the App Manager, click "Create New App", check the boxes of the libraries you want to include by default (jQuery, Ember, etc.), and it would then generate a Hello World app folder with all those files included.<br>

              Heck, Firefox Developer Tools is practically already an IDE. All that really remains for it is a "Resources" tab with text editing ability.<br>

              EDIT: Additionally, being beginner-friendly would be a huge advantage to Firefox OS because its target market is the developing world. Only requiring an installation of Firefox to develop apps would significantly lower the barrier for who could learn to develop apps. Locals could quickly learn to make an app that caters specifically to their local community (what farms are hiring, where the cleanest water is, etc.).</p>
